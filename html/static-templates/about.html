            <p class="lede">Collective Office is an architecture and design practice that articulates the customer story through physical space. Where art lies at the intersection crafting the clients&rsquo; journey and their design solution. We look for ways to infuse your identity—who you are, how you live and work, what&rsquo;s important to you—into your physical environment. We don’t just prescribe colors and textures and furniture—we consider behaviors and work patterns and all the factors that make you and your business unique. We’re not just designing spaces. We’re crafting contemporary experiences. And those experiences are exclusive to you.</p>

                    <h3>Architecture</h3>
                    <p>Architecture is the art and practice of designing and constructing buildings. At Collective Office, when we talk about architecture, we’re really talking about the entire process we use to provide creative, design-forward architectural solutions that deal with site, structure, building envelope, and programmatic use. Our architectural process is unique and iterative, which means that it’s constantly refined and challenged on each project so the result is a tailored client solution. We’re thoughtful yet ambitious in our approach, while also being grounded in analytics and metrics. The result is architectural solutions that are brilliantly realized and artfully fashioned.</p>

                    <h3>Interiors</h3>
                    <p>Interiors is the art and process of designing the interior architectural components of a room or building. Interior design encompasses so much more than simply selecting the furnishings of a room. It involves developing design solutions with an acute and discerning eye for detail and executing a well-researched approach to conceiving how space should feel—and, perhaps more so, how it functions. At Collective Office, we believe your interior space should be an extension of you. It should nurture your lifestyle and accentuate your work practices, helping you stylishly engage in your pursuits.</p>

                    <h3>Branding</h3>
                    <p>Your brand is your reputation, your moral code and your value system. It’s what you’re made of and what you represent. It’s your project and your space. It's your company’s DNA. Dynamic brands are built by shaping clear messages by creating platforms for conversations with audiences. Brand thinking is integral to creating great architecture and creating cultural memory. We are branding experts with more than a decade of experience helping our clients define and love of their story. We help create intention with communication, by building the love around who they are and what they do.</p>

                    <p>Tyler Moench grew up around Minneapolis, Minnesota.

His work during graduate school primarily revolved around exploring the connection between emerging parametric design tools and digital fabrication techniques, and their impact on the design process. Outside of the architecture office, Tyler enjoys tinkering with anything that he can get his hands on, ranging from making furniture, to wrenching on bicycles, to building 3D printers.</p>
